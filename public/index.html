    <h3>September</h3>

                Undertaken in Melbourne, Victoria throughout the month of September, I delve into the bleak and desolate
                aspects of urban life. These images were taken spontaneously, without any predetermined plans, to
                capture the unvarnished reality of the city.

                I aim to narrate a point-and-shoot story of Melbourne that is often obscured by the glossy facade of
                urban life. These photographs reveal the forgotten, abandoned, and desolate corners and individuals of
                the city, painting a picture of isolation and decay that is frequently concealed. These visuals stand as
                a stark commentary on the inevitable decay and decline that urban environments can experience.
